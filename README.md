# HIV_inhibitor_prediction
Main objective of this colab notebook is about providing a simple pipeline for predicting HIV inhibitors.

Graph isomorphism network (GIN) with edge is used as a model for training procedure.

PyTorch, Torch_geometric and Rdkit libraries are used and all details about installing them can be found in this notebook.

*Caution*: 

GNNs are really senstive to hyperparameters. So fine-tuning them can improve my proposed model.

I hope this simple tutorial about molecular property prediction can be helpful for you.
